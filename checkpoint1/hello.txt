Hi!

I'm John Duan. I'm a senior here at the University of Michigan currently slated to graduate this Spring after majoring in Data Science and Economics.

A fun fact about myself is that in fourth grade I thought my teacher was talking about 'tourists' when she was actually talking about 'terrorists'. And I still have hangups because of that.
